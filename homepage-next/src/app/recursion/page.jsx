          <p>
            One Winterfell proof over <code className="text-[#00ff41]">VmAir</code>, Blake3-hashed, ~5–11 KB for the
            examples in this repo, growing with trace length. It verifies off-chain in milliseconds. Nothing about it is
            compact enough, or in a format cheap enough, to check inside an EVM transaction — a STARK is typically tens of
            KB minimum, too large and too gas-expensive to verify directly. See <Link href="/onchain-verifier" className="text-[#00ff41] underline">the On-Chain Verifier page</Link>.

        <Section title="The two paths">
          <p>
            <strong className="text-white">(a) Recursive STARK composition.</strong> Prove, in a second, smaller STARK,
            the statement "the first STARK proof verifies." This stays inside STARK-land (no pairing-based trusted setup),
            but means implementing a STARK verifier <em>as an AIR</em> — encoding FRI folding, Merkle path checks, and
            out-of-domain constraint evaluation as constraints in a new circuit. Well-trodden elsewhere (SP1, RISC Zero,
            StarkWare's own construction do this) — but not yet designed for this specific AIR.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong className="text-white">(b) External SNARK wrapping.</strong> Prove "the STARK verifier accepts this
            proof" as a Groth16 or PLONK circuit over BN254 — a field switch from the current 128-bit prime, since
            pairing-friendly curves use different primes. Needs a trusted setup and R1CS/arithmetic-circuit tooling
            entirely outside what this repo currently touches.
          </p>
          <p>Both paths converge on the same hard sub-problem: implementing this STARK verifier's arithmetic as constraints in some proving system.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="What's specific to this AIR, versus generic">
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li><strong className="text-white">Field:</strong> Winterfell's 128-bit prime. Any recursive verifier circuit must do arithmetic in this exact field, or handle a field switch explicitly — get this wrong and the recursive proof verifies something other than intended.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Hash:</strong> Blake3_256 — no EVM precompile, no widely-used circuit-friendly implementation. The Keccak-family switch flagged in the On-Chain Verifier page applies here too, and should happen first regardless of which recursion path is chosen.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Constraint count:</strong> VmAir has one transition constraint shape today — unusually small. A recursive circuit's size scales with the inner AIR's complexity, so it would need redoing as branching, registers, and memory grow the AIR. Worth sequencing after the ISA stabilizes.</li>
          </ul>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Open questions">
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3">
            <li><strong className="text-white">Do we even need hiding?</strong> This system has no secret witness anywhere — see <Link href="/architecture" className="text-[#00ff41] underline">Architecture</Link>. If that never changes, recursion only needs to solve succinctness, not zero-knowledge — a meaningfully smaller problem, worth confirming before designing around hiding that isn't needed.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">What's the real proving-time budget?</strong> No target has been set — current settings are correctness-first, not performance-first.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Composition depth:</strong> one level, or folding many executions before the final wrap? The latter amortizes the expensive wrap step but is meaningfully more design work.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Trusted setup, if path (b):</strong> a per-circuit Groth16 setup versus a universal PLONK setup — different stacks entirely.</li>

          <p>
            It does not block the ISA expansion, the MCP endpoint, or anything else in this repo. Nothing here is
            implemented, and nothing should be started opportunistically alongside other work — it deserves being picked
            up as its own deliberate effort, after the Keccak-hasher switch and after the AIR has stabilized. See{' '}
