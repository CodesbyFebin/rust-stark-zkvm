          <p>
            Building a real STARK-based VM with unconstrained branching, memory, and a full RISC-V-compatible instruction
            set is a multi-year effort for a team, not a single session. This project picked the smallest slice that still
            has the essential hard part: an AIR whose transition constraints correctly gate multiple instruction types via
            opcode selectors, with per-row assertions that bind the proof to an exact program — the same core technique
            (generalized) that real STARK-based VMs like RISC Zero, SP1, Cairo, and Miden use. Once that pattern is
            validated, extending it is additive work, not a redesign.

              <strong className="text-white">Loops:</strong> a dynamically-sized trace (bounded by a max-cycle count,
              padded/truncated based on actual execution length) so JZ/JNZ can jump backward too. The "verifier
              re-executes and asserts everything" trick still works — but trace-length selection and the resulting
              proof-size variability need real design.
