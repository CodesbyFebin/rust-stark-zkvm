          <p>
            Every real production STARK-on-Ethereum verifier — Starknet's, RISC Zero's, SP1's — is thousands of lines of
            specialized Solidity/Yul, built by teams with dedicated cryptography engineers, re-audited whenever the AIR or
            hash choice changes. Doing it correctly but insecurely doesn't fail loudly — it produces a verifier that
            silently accepts invalid proofs, strictly worse than <code className="text-[#00ff41]">AttestedVerifier</code>'s
            explicit trust assumption. That's why <code className="text-[#00ff41]">UnimplementedStarkVerifier</code> reverts
            instead of stubbing something "close enough."

        <Section title="The path production systems actually take: wrap it in a SNARK">
          <p>
            Because verifying a STARK directly on the EVM is so gas-heavy, most production systems instead run the STARK
            verifier itself as a program, prove <em>that verifier's execution</em> with a SNARK that has a small, fixed,
            cheap-to-verify proof and a real EVM precompile for the underlying pairing curve, and put only that small
            SNARK-verification call on-chain. STARK for cheap, fast, transparent-setup proving of the actual computation;
            a thin SNARK wrapper only for the part that has to run on Ethereum. This is "recursion" in practice — see{' '}
            <Link href="/recursion" className="text-[#00ff41] underline">the Recursion page</Link> for what that would specifically require for this AIR.
